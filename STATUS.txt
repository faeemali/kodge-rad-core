This project is very incomplete.

- rad-core works
- basic server (in another project) works
- a few basic apps (echo, webserver, wrapper) work, but are in another project
- a UI needs to be built possibly (my lowest priority)

a lot more apps need to be created. A lot more testing needs to be done. Scenarios like broadcast messages etc need to
be implemented.

In short, it needs work. If anyone is interested in contributing, let me know
