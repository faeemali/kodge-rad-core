- figure out how to uniquely identify apps at runtime, so if an app is
  used more than once, it can be identified (maybe use tags)
- for performance, consider replacing am_must_die with a channel to the control
  plane
- !!!(necessary?) include the workflow id in messages, to allow for inter-workflow routing
- add apps
- maybe add a runtime file for later termination of apps
- build a ui
- build server framework to download apps from the web (plugin framework)
- add in licensing support
