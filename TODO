- add a message id to allow for sync message processing
- consider implementing xargs-style functionality for start_stop containers
- !!!(necessary?) include the workflow id in messages, to allow for inter-workflow routing
- add apps
- maybe add a runtime file for later termination of apps
- build a ui
- build server framework to download apps from the web (plugin framework)
- add in licensing support


Sample app:
- webserver with 2 endpoints (e1, e2)
- e1 goes to an app/script (stdin/stdout)
- e2 dumps to a sqlite db
