- consider implementing xargs-style functionality for start_stop containers
- !!!(necessary?) include the workflow id in messages, to allow for inter-workflow routing
- add apps
- maybe add a runtime file for later termination of apps
- build a ui
- build server framework to download apps from the web (plugin framework)
- add in licensing support


App Ideas:

I/O:
- file
- socket (unix/tcp/udp/netcat)
- excel/ods doc
- word/odf doc
- rabbitmq
- kafka
- mysql
- postgresql
- sqlite3
- mongo
- gpio (rpi)
- i2c/spi tx/rx?
- rs232 tx/rx (or socat?)
- redis/valkey?
- aws (s3, kinesis, mq, dynamodb)
- webserver
- grpc server
- tcp/udp server
- email
- whatsapp/telegram/other?
- authentication? google/aws/other?
- something like the unix expect utility (or just use expect?)
- something to monitor a directory and report when a file is added/deleted
- rest client? (postman? curl?)
- tx/rx mqtt message
- oauth2 (login on website; auth details sync'ed to app?)

transformers/filters:
- xml/json/text/yaml
- encryption
- excel

other:
- logger

App examples:
- call webserver endpoint, feed data to transformer (eg. get username + action), read data from db based on
  username, send data to (rabbitmq + logger + custom logic), custom logic performs a calculation with the data
  and updates excel spreadsheet
- backup image from sd card, read the list of user/password details from a text file and copy the backup
  file to a bunch of other computers
- read data (eg. logs) from database, filter out the necessary items, custom logic to calculate stats,
  if problem detected use cURL/email to send notification
- monitor a directory until a new jpeg is detected. Then, use imagemagick to resize the image and copy the
  thumbnail to a different directory
- When motion sensor detects movement a gpio is toggled on rpi which sends a message via mqtt. On the server,
  the mqtt message is received and, 3 people specified in a excel spreadsheet are emailed
