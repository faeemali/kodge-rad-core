apps:
  - input1
  - processor1
  - output1
connections:
  #connections can only be output->input, never input->output.
  #output->input is eg. source to a processor, or
  #processor->processor, or even processor->output.
  #but input->output is basically a processor of some sort.
  #eg. suppose there's a processor that does json->xml.
  #In that case, the INPUT will be json, and the OUTPUT will
  #be XML. So the processor (i.e. the code) does the input->output
  #conversion. For that reason, connections can only be output->input
